NavigationDrawer的使用
--------------

NavigationDrawer正确的使用方式

NavigationDrawer最好保证以下几点

* The navigation drawer should overlap the app bar
* Profile pickers (large and small) should maintain consistency and unity in style and typography
* The way list items are styled (iconography, typography, and color highlight) should feel familiar between all apps
* Actions secondary or tertiary to the app's primary destinations (Settings, Help & Feedback) should be consistently deemphasized as list items
